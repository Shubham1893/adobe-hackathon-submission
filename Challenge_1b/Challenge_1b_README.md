# Challenge 1b: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## ðŸ§  Overview

This is the solution for **Challenge 1b**, an advanced PDF analysis system that processes multiple documents and extracts the most relevant content based on a specific user persona and their job-to-be-done.  
It operates entirely **offline and on-device**, leveraging a lightweight AI model for semantic understanding.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features & Approach

The solution uses a modern semantic search pipeline to achieve high relevance scores:

- **Persona-based Content Analysis**  
  The user's persona and job description are combined into a rich semantic query.
  
- **Intelligent Sectioning**  
  Structured outlines from Challenge 1a are used to break down PDFs into meaningful, context-rich sections.
  
- **Importance Ranking**  
  A pre-trained Sentence-Transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) converts queries and sections into vector embeddings. Cosine similarity scores help rank the sections by relevance.
  
- **Structured JSON Output**  
  Outputs a ranked list of relevant sections, complete with metadata and short summaries.
